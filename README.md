Deep learning to extract Breast Cancer diagnosis concepts

This repository contains code about  a proposal to extract breast cancer diagnosis concepts using  BERT models trained on an extrarnal corpus  corpus (lung cancer). We show the possibility of applying deep learning-based models to predict cancer concepts in a different dataset to the one they were trained on. This proposal is based on transfer learning techique. Figure 1 describes the proposal in this repository.
